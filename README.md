# Terraform AWS Static Website Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to use Terraform for setting up an AWS S3 bucket to host a static website. The setup includes configuring the bucket, defining policies, and uploading static content.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Terraform Installed**: Install Terraform on your machine. You can download it from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account with appropriate permissions to create S3 buckets and manage IAM policies.

### Steps Covered

1. **Setup Terraform Environment**
   - Install Terraform.
   - Configure AWS credentials for Terraform.

2. **Define Terraform Configuration**
   - Create Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`).

3. **Configure AWS S3 Bucket**
   - Define the S3 bucket resource.
   - Configure bucket properties and website hosting.

4. **Deploy and Manage**
   - Initialize Terraform.
   - Apply the configuration to create resources.
   - Upload static content to the S3 bucket.

### Detailed Instructions

#### Step 1: Setup Terraform Environment

Install Terraform by downloading it from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). Configure AWS credentials using one of the methods described in the Terraform documentation.

#### Step 2: Define Terraform Configuration

Create a new directory for your Terraform project. Inside this directory, create the necessary Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`). Define AWS provider, S3 bucket resource, policies, and any other required configurations.

#### Step 3: Configure AWS S3 Bucket

In `main.tf`, define an AWS S3 bucket resource with the desired bucket name and website configuration. Optionally, configure public access policies using AWS IAM policies or S3 bucket policies.

#### Step 4: Deploy and Manage

Initialize Terraform in your project directory (`terraform init`). Apply the Terraform configuration to create resources (`terraform apply`). Verify that the S3 bucket is created and configured correctly.

#### Step 5: Upload Static Content

Upload your static website content (HTML, CSS, JS files) to the S3 bucket. Ensure your index and error documents are correctly configured in the S3 bucket website configuration.
